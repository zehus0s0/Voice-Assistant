# Voice Assistant in Python

This project is a **Python-based Voice Assistant** designed to provide hands-free assistance with a variety of tasks. The assistant uses speech recognition to process user commands and responds either by performing an action or providing voice-based feedback.

## Key Features
- **Speech Recognition**:  
  Listens to user commands using a microphone and processes them using the **SpeechRecognition** library.  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:  
  Converts the assistant's responses into audible speech using **pyttsx3** or similar libraries.  
- **Task Automation**:  
  - Web searches (e.g., Google, Wikipedia).  
  - Opening applications (e.g., browser, music player).  
  - Providing weather updates, time, or general information.  
- **Customizable Commands**:  
  Add, remove, or modify commands easily to tailor the assistant to your needs.

- Python 3.x
